            <h3>What is the difference between <b>Local Storage</b> and <b>Session Storage</b>?</h3>
            <p>
                The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin.
                sessionStorage is
                similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                sessionStorage is
                cleared when the page session ends. <br>
                Data stored in sessionStorage is specific to the protocol of the page. In particular, data stored by a
                script on a site
                accessed with HTTP is put in a different sessionStorage object from the same site accessed
                with HTTPS.

            <h3>What is the difference between <b>Global Scope</b> and <b>Block Scope</b>?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Globals Scope</b><br>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope.
                Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
                conditional state
                can access that variable. <br>
                <b>Block Scope</b><br>
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the
                curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something
                else. You are only
                allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

            <h3>What is JavaScript Eventloop?</h3>
            <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on
                a single
                thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let's take a
                look at what
                happens on the back-end. <br>
                The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a
                function is
                finished, it is popped from the stack. <br>
                The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                queue data
                structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.

            <h3>How many causes are there to make "undefined" error in JS?</h3>
            <p>
                Mainly Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been
                defined. <br>
                The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined. It is one of JavaScript's
                primitive types.
                8 ways to Get Undifined <br>

                1- variable that is not initialized will give undefined <br>
                2- function with no return <br>
                3- parameter that is not passed will be undefined <br>
                4- property that doesnt exist on an object will give undefined <br>
                5- accessing array elements outside of the index range <br>
                6- If you return nothing on the right side will return undefined <br>
                7- deleting an element inside an array <br>
                8- set a value directly to undefined <br>
